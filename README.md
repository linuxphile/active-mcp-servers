## Overview

This is a curated directory of actively maintained Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, focusing on production-ready integrations that extend AI assistants' capabilities to interact with external tools, services, and data sources.

## Purpose

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard introduced by Anthropic that enables AI assistants (such as Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, and others) to connect to external systems securely. Think of it as "USB-C for AI" - a universal interface that allows language models to:

- Access real-time data from databases and APIs

- Interact with development tools and platforms

- Manage cloud infrastructure and deployments

- Query observability and monitoring systems

- Integrate with business productivity tools

- Fetch content from external sources

This list serves as a reliable reference for developers and organizations looking to extend their AI workflows with vetted, actively maintained MCP servers.

## Curation Criteria

This directory prioritizes:

1. **Official Support**: Servers maintained by the original product/platform companies (e.g., GitHub's official MCP server, Stripe's official integration)

1. **Active Development**: Only servers with recent commits and ongoing maintenance

1. **Production Ready**: Servers designed for real-world use cases, not experimental prototypes

1. **Community Alternatives**: Where official servers don't exist, we include well-maintained community projects

We specifically **exclude**:

- Archived or deprecated servers

- Unmaintained projects

- Experimental proof-of-concepts without ongoing support

## Use Cases

This curated list helps you:

- **Discover** reliable integrations for your AI development workflow

- **Evaluate** which platforms offer official MCP support

- **Implement** production-grade AI agent capabilities

- **Avoid** deprecated or unmaintained solutions

- **Plan** AI integration strategies based on available tooling

## Organization

The list is organized by functional categories:

- **Core Reference Servers** (Anthropic's foundational implementations)

- **Version Control & Code Platforms**

- **Cloud Infrastructure**

- **Databases**

- **AI/ML Platforms**

- **Development & Testing Tools**

- **Search & Web Data**

- **Payment & Commerce**

- **Communication & Collaboration**

- **Business & Productivity**

- **Infrastructure & Deployment**

- **Observability & Monitoring**

- **Content & Media**

Each entry includes:

- Server name

- Direct link to official documentation or repository

- Brief description of capabilities

## For Whom

This list is valuable for:

- **AI Application Developers** building agents and assistants

- **DevOps Teams** integrating AI into development workflows

- **Product Teams** evaluating AI integration possibilities

- **CTOs and Technical Leaders** planning AI strategy

- **Individual Developers** exploring MCP capabilities

The focus on officially supported, actively maintained servers ensures you're building on stable foundations rather than experimental projects that may be abandoned.
